Macros:
- `_DEBUG`

  由使用的 CRT 决定

- `NDEBUG`

  C/C++ 标准

  当定义时，`assert()` 将被忽略

## Date, time and timestamp
Macro | Standard | Description
--- | --- | ---
`__DATE__` | | Expands to the date of translation, a character string literal of the form `"Mmm dd yyyy"`. The name of the month is as if generated by [asctime()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/asctime) and the first character of `"dd"` is a space if the day of the month is less than 10.
`__TIME__` | | Expands to the time of translation, a character string literal of the form `"hh:mm:ss"`, as in the time generated by [asctime()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/asctime).
`__TIMESTAMP__` | MSVC | Expands to a string literal that contains the date and time of the last modification of the current source file, in the abbreviated, constant length form returned by [asctime()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/asctime), for example, `Fri 19 Aug 13:32:58 2016`.

Note that Visual Studio's driver project templates have these macros disabled (`/d1nodatetime`) by default, you can enable them in `Driver Setting → Driver Model → Allow Date, Time and TimeStamp`. [^datetime-driver]
